## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the usage of **RabbitMQ** by building a simple group chat system. The system consists of a **publisher** and a **subscriber** communicating via RabbitMQ for real-time message delivery. By following four key steps, youâ€™ll learn how to set up RabbitMQ, integrate it into a Node.js application, and create a rudimentary group chat experience.

### **Steps Overview:**

1. **RabbitMQ Docker Container & Basic Publisher/Subscriber (pub.js & sub.js):**
   - Set up RabbitMQ in a Docker container.
   - Build the basic publisher and subscriber in Node.js that communicate using RabbitMQ.

2. **"Serverizes" the Publisher:**
   - Refactor the publisher into an HTTP server that can receive messages from a client and publish them to RabbitMQ.

3. **"Serverizes" the Subscriber with a Pug View Client:**
   - Convert the subscriber into an HTTP server that listens to RabbitMQ and renders messages to the client using **Pug**.
   - Create a simple **HTMX**-powered frontend to display the chat messages.

4. **Post Messages from Client:**
   - Build a client-side form that submits chat messages.
   - When a message is posted, it triggers the publisher to send it to the queue, where it will be consumed by the subscriber and displayed to all users.

## **Motivation**

The motivation behind this project is to introduce the concept of **message queues** and **asynchronous communication** using RabbitMQ. Building a simple group chat provides a hands-on, practical experience with these concepts, allowing you to:

- **Learn RabbitMQ:** Understand how message queues work in real-time applications, especially in distributed systems.
- **Understand Publisher/Subscriber Model:** Implement a basic publisher/subscriber model using RabbitMQ to send and receive messages.
- **Work with Node.js and Express:** Develop a rudimentary backend to manage communication and handle frontend requests.
- **Build Real-time Web Applications:** Create a responsive, real-time chat app with **HTMX** and **Pug**.

This project is designed to be beginner-friendly, with each step introducing new concepts and components that gradually build towards a complete real-time group chat application using RabbitMQ.

## **Future Improvements**

While the current project provides a simple introduction to RabbitMQ and real-time messaging, there are several areas where the project can be modernized or enhanced for better scalability, usability, and performance:

### **1. Modernizing the Frontend**

#### **a. Replace Pug with a Modern Frontend Framework**
To modernize the user interface, consider replacing Pug with a frontend framework like **React**, **Vue.js**, or **Svelte**. These frameworks provide better support for dynamic content and reactivity, making it easier to handle real-time updates, manage state, and build more interactive UIs.

- **React Components**: Build reusable components for different parts of the chat (message list, message input, etc.).
- **State Management**: Use tools like **Redux** or **React Context** to manage the state of the application and ensure a smooth user experience.

#### **b. Real-Time Updates with WebSockets or SSE **
Rather than relying on periodic polling, you could implement **WebSockets** to enable real-time communication. By connecting clients to the server over a WebSocket, messages can be pushed to clients immediately after being sent, providing a more responsive chat experience.

#### **c. UI/UX Enhancements**
- **Styling**: Improve the design with modern UI frameworks like **TailwindCSS** or **Bootstrap** for responsive and clean layouts.
- **Notifications**: Add browser notifications to alert users when new messages arrive.
- **Message Formatting**: Allow users to send rich-text messages with formatting (e.g., bold, italics, links).

### **2. Dockerizing the Node.js Apps**

#### **a. Containerize Publisher and Subscriber**
To improve portability and ensure that the application runs consistently across different environments, consider **Dockerizing** both the **publisher** and **subscriber** Node.js applications.
